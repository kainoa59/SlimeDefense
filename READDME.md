Tower Defense Game: Slime Defender

In Slime Defender, players places tueerts on base locations throughout the map to automatically fight enemies for them. Turrets are purchased with in game currency that is earned by defeating enemies. Each turret placed will increase the cost of future turrets of the same type, but each wave of enemies comes with new rewards. Enemies money drops are increased in each wave as well as their health and spawn speed.

Main features:

Turret Placement: Choose from two turret types, each with different abilities and fire rates. Strategically position them on designated bases to maximize their effectiveness against incoming enemies.

Waves of Enemies: Face off against progressively harder enemy waves, each designed to test your tactical skills. As you progress, enemies gain strength and resilience, requiring careful planning and upgrades.

Resource Management: Earn money by defeating enemies spend it to purchase new turrets or upgrade existing ones (in future updates). With every 50 coins earned, you can place additional turrets to enhance your defense, and turrets increase in cost by 1.5x for each turret purchased.

Health and Lives System: Keep an eye on your life count as enemies approach your base. Lose a life each time an enemy reaches the final waypoint, adding a layer of urgency to your defense strategy.

Audio and Visual Effects: Hopefully the singular projectile noise doesn't get too annoying as you hold on to the edge of your seating waiting for Slimer Defense 2!
